I do know you need your locale installed on your system:
Add your locale to -> /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local

Then run "dpkg-reconfigure locales" to configure the system.

However, even though I've done this, I still can't get gettext strings translated.

Reiniciar o hacer reload del server.

My translations work fine under a Gentoo system, just not any Ubuntu servers. So I know my script works.

Anyways, help would be appreciated.
